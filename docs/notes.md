# Development Notes

## Project Status
- All tasks completed and tested
- All checkpoints passed
- Ready for production use

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Audio Recording
- Using PyAudio for audio capture with configurable settings
- MP3 conversion using pydub for efficient storage
- Implemented device detection and selection for flexibility
- Added error handling for audio device issues

### User Interface
- Rich library used for modern CLI interface
- Keyboard controls implemented for better UX
- Status indicators during recording
- Clear menu structure with intuitive navigation

### Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage across all components
- Mock objects used for hardware dependencies
- Integration tests verify complete workflows
- Test isolation achieved through proper mocking

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling for audio devices
- File system operations protected
- User input validation implemented
- Clear error messages provided to users

### Performance Optimizations
- Memory management optimized for long recordings
- M3 Ultra specific optimizations implemented
- Efficient file handling with proper cleanup

## Known Limitations
1. Requires administrator privileges for keyboard hooks on macOS
2. Audio device selection requires proper hardware permissions
3. MP3 conversion requires ffmpeg installation

## Installation Requirements
1. Python 3.9 or higher
2. ffmpeg for audio conversion
3. PortAudio for audio capture
4. Administrator privileges for keyboard control

## Future Improvements
1. Consider alternative keyboard control methods for non-admin users
2. Add support for more audio formats
3. Implement cloud backup functionality
4. Add GUI interface option

## Resolved Issues
1. Fixed keyboard hook issues in tests by proper mocking
2. Resolved audio buffer management for long recordings
3. Fixed file handling race conditions
4. Addressed memory leaks in audio processing
5. Fixed test isolation issues
