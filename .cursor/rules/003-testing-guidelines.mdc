# Testing Workflow

## Usage
- Tests must be developed alongside functionality
- All tests must pass before marking a task complete
- Checkpoints serve as verification points for multiple related tasks

## Rules
1. WRITE tests before or alongside the implementation of functionality
2. RUN tests frequently during development
3. ENSURE test coverage for all critical paths
4. AUTOMATE tests where possible
5. INCLUDE edge cases and error scenarios in tests
6. UPDATE tests when requirements change

## Test Naming Convention
- Use format: `test_[function/module]_[scenario]_[expected_result]`
