# Project Documentation Guidelines

## Notes File
Path: `docs/notes.md`

### Usage
- Tracks important aspects of the Slides2Video application design
- Reference and update this file as development progresses
- Maintain the structured format while adding new content

### Update Rules
1. READ the notes file at the beginning of each development session
2. UPDATE the relevant sections when making significant design decisions
3. MAINTAIN the hierarchical structure when adding new content
4. DATE all entries in the format [YYYY-MM-DD]
5. KEEP entries concise and focused on rationale, not implementation details
6. LINK to relevant code files or documentation when appropriate using relative paths
7. MOVE completed TODOs to the relevant sections with implementation details
8. DOCUMENT challenges and their solutions promptly

### Content Guidelines
- Prioritize WHY over HOW in architectural decision documentation
- Document trade-offs considered in design decisions
- Record performance implications of significant decisions
- Note security considerations explicitly
- Track third-party dependencies and version constraints
- Document non-obvious design patterns or architectural approaches
- Note any deviations from the initial design document and their rationale

### Format
- New Decision: "[DATE]: Decision to [DECISION] because [RATIONALE]."
- New Challenge: "**Challenge**: [DESCRIPTION]\n**Solution**: [SOLUTION]\n**Impact**: [IMPACT]"
- New Todo: "[ ] [DESCRIPTION] - [PRIORITY: High/Medium/Low] [ESTIMATION]"
- Completed Todo: "[x] [DESCRIPTION] - Implemented in [FILE/COMPONENT]"

## Design Document
Path: `docs/Design.md`

### Usage
- Serves as the authoritative source of the application design
- Refer to this document for architectural decisions and component specifications
- Use as reference when implementing features to ensure adherence to the design

### Reference Rules
1. CONSULT the design document before implementing any feature
2. ALIGN implementation with the specifications in the design document
3. NOTE any deviations from the design in the notes.md file with clear rationale
4. UPDATE the design document only for major structural changes after consultation
5. PRESERVE design decisions by referencing the document section in code comments
